# GoL
Python script to simulate the game of life

#play the game of life
the application can run in two modes
- inserting the configuration as command line parameter:
```
python .\conway.py .\config1.txt
```
When running this way the grid will be prepared with the predefined values contained in the file.
**if the file doesn't exists or the format is not valid, the program won't run, check attached configurations for guidance**
**The configurations files have the appearance of an array, the values are separated by white spaces, this is necessary to work**

- run the program without a parameter:

```
python .\conway.py
```
when running like this the program will ask you to introduce the size of the universe (universe is an N*N grid), and will fill the spaces randomly

any comment or inconvience you can send me an email, to check what's wrong.

have fun!
